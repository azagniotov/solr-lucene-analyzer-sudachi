 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking. To improve performance one could
 - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
 only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
 value.
 - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
 return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
 - remove all unneeded copyField statements
 - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
 for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
 catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.
